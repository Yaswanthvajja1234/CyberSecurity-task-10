**CYBER SECURITY INTERNSHIP
Task 10: Firewall Configuration & Testing (Practical)
Name: Yaswanth Vajja
Organization: Elevate Labs
Internship: Cyber Security Internship
Date: January 2026**
1. Introduction to Firewalls
A firewall is a security mechanism that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic
based on defined rules to protect systems from unauthorized access.
2. Firewall Concepts
Firewalls use inbound and outbound rules to allow or block traffic. They act as a protective barrier
between trusted and untrusted networks.
3. Tool Used
Windows Defender Firewall or UFW was used to configure firewall rules for this practical task.
4. Practical Objective
The objective is to configure firewall rules, allow or deny ports, test connectivity, and analyze the
impact of firewall rules.
5. Firewall Rule Configuration
Firewall rules were configured to allow necessary services and block unnecessary or risky ports.
6. Allow and Deny Ports
Specific ports were allowed or denied based on system requirements to reduce the attack surface.
7. Testing Connectivity
Connectivity tests were conducted to ensure allowed services worked and blocked services were
inaccessible.
8. Blocking Malicious IP Address
A sample malicious IP address was blocked using firewall rules to prevent unauthorized access
attempts.
9. Observing Firewall Logs
Firewall logs were reviewed to observe allowed and blocked traffic for monitoring and analysis.
10. Impact Analysis
Firewall configuration enhanced system security by preventing unauthorized access while
maintaining required connectivity.
11. Documentation of Firewall Rules
All firewall rules were documented, including allowed ports, blocked ports, and blocked IP
addresses.
12. Conclusion
This task provided practical experience in firewall configuration and testing, strengthening firewall
management skills.
